# Personal Expenses App

My First Flutter Project

This app is aimed to track transactions. Transactions can be added with a date and the app also gives a chart that keeps track of credit and debit amount for each day of the past 7 days. It has a basic UI and can store and delete transactions. Database used : SQLite
